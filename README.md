Project 3: Spots

**Overview**

An image sharing site with a focus on responsive design.

**Intro**

This project was designed with the intent of creating a responsive website that reacts to varying changes in screen size, either due to device size or altering the viewport on the device itself.

**Tech Stack**

-HTML
-CSS
-Media Queries
-Responsive Design

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Deployment**

The webiste is deployed to my GitHub linked below.
